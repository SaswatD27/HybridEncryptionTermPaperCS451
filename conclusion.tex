\section{Conclusion}

\label{sec:conclusion}

Hybrid Encryption is a very clever and sophisticated idea that grants the advantages of both Symmetric Encryption and Asymmetric Encryption to any system implementing it. We started off by briefly discussing the key differences between Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption and explained how Hybrid Cryptosystems are built upon both of them.

Some common definitions of security that are frequently used when designing Hybrid Cryptosystems are also introduced, so that the reader gets a general idea of the level of security of a Hybrid Cryptosystem and how its security compares with the level of security  of Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption schemes.\\

The rest of the paper was divided into two sections. The first section was about one of the most popular Hybrid Cryptosystems : the hybrid of ElGamal and AES algorithms.\\

In the second section we detailed the SSL Handshake, a security protocol that utilises Hybrid Encryption and one that we interact with almost everyday. Some information about SSL certificates was provided to enable the reader to understand exactly what transpires in the SSL Handshake.
