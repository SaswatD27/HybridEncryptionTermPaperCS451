\appendix
The Appendix should contain the name, position, and company (or other relevant information) for the person(s) you interviewed or the places you visited.
For interviews, include your list of questions and indicate if the interview was in person, by phone, or by email.
(In-person interviews are best, but may not be available for some topics.) Include the person's answers.
(A summary is ok.) If you identify the person fully and quote extensively from the interview in the body of your paper you do not have to include the appendix.
The Appendix does not count toward the 4000 word requirement.
